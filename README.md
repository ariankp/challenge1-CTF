# challenge1-CTF
This was the second challenge for that job interview which I had to reverse engineer a program to get the password of the executable. 
The password was AMNP16FV. the documentation that how I got the password is available in the pdf. I used ollydbg for reversing it. The program changed the password if you were trying to debug it with olly. However, I included patched version too.
